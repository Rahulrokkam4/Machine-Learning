 A Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a very powerful and versatile Machine Learning
 model, capable of performing linear or nonlinear classification, regression, and even
 outlier detection. It is one of the most popular models in Machine Learning, and any
one interested in Machine Learning should have it in their toolbox. SVMs are partic
ularly well suited for classification of complex but small- or medium-sized datasets.
