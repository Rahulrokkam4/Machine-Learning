K-Means Clustering is an Unsupervised Machine Learning algorithm which groups the unlabeled dataset into different clusters.
# importing
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
# Elbow Method
The Elbow method is one of the most popular ways to find the optimal number of clusters. This method uses the concept of WCSS value. WCSS stands for Within Cluster Sum of Squares, which defines the total variations within a cluster. The formula to calculate the value of WCSS (for 3 clusters) is given below:
sse=sse1+sse2+.....+ssen
WCSS= ∑Pi in Cluster1 distance(Pi C1)2 +∑Pi in Cluster2distance(Pi C2)2+∑Pi in CLuster3 distance(Pi C3)2
In the above formula of WCSS

#Sum of Squared Error
 ∑xi in Cluster distance(xi C1)^2
